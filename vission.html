            <h1>What Is a Vision Statement?</h1>
               <p>A vision statement is like a photograph of your future business, which gives your business shape and direction.</p>
                
               <p>A vision statement provides the direction and describes what the founder wants the organization to achieve in the future; it’s more about the “what” of a business. It is different from a mission statement, which describes the purpose of an organization and more about the “how” of a business.</p>
                
               <p>If you were to take a photo of your future business now, what would it look like? What do you want your business to be recognized for one day?</p>
                
                <p>You need to have a crystal clear vision when you start out, otherwise you can get easily lost in deciding the best way forward. When you are making strategic decisions for your business and even daily operation decisions, your vision statement will give you the inspiration and targeted direction you need.</p>
                
                <h1>The Importance of a Vision Statement</h1>
                <p>Without a vision statement, your business will lack motivation to keep going.</p>
                
               <p>If you don’t aim for anything, you might not hit anything. The more specific and clear you are, the better your chances are at seeing your vision turn into reality.</p>
                
               <p>The importance of a vision statement cannot be overlooked; not only does it provide long term direction and guidance, but it also gives you the inspiration and the necessary energy to keep going when you feel lost.</p>
                
               <p>Always keep your vision statement alive by revisiting it regularly and communicating your vision with other members of the team, to inspire and motivate them as well.</p>
